## Problem Description 

It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise. The Dining Philosopher Problem states that 5 philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pick up the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.
